## General Mouse Usage
The left mouse button is used for most activities.  Without Shift or
Control, it is used for editing tags or control points.  With Shift
it is used for inserting or deleting tags or control points.  With
Control it is used to Select or Deselect a channel, adding it to or
removing it from the set of selected channels.

Outside of a channel pane, the left mouse button without shift or 
control, zooms and pans the time range for the entire display unless
on a tag in the Tag pane.

Within a channel pane, the wheel zooms the vertical data range about
the location of the cursor.  The right mouse button brings up the
tools menu for the channel pane.
