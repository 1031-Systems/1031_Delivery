############## tabledefs ###############################################################
#   This tabledefs file is for defining the available sets of Digital and PWM ports
# that may be used in your system.  In general, ports should be defined in blocks
# via convenience functions.
#
#
#   Since it is quite possible to make mistakes here, there is a test function available
# in main in tables.py.  Simply running "python tables.py -r" will run all the checks to
# validate the configuration herein.  Adding the "-v" option will output all the port
# assignments for additional verification.
############## Define your configuration here ##########################################
#
# These examples show how to specify four PWM ports, two digital ports, the three
# primary inputs, and four special trigger inputs on a Maestro board.  Note that the
# Maestro board must have a minimum of 13 available channels.  Inputs attached to
# channels that do not exist on the board produce unspecified results.

# PWM Port Definitions
# Example - 4 servos on Maestro channels 2-5 on board 12 assigned to ports 21-24
configureMaestroPWM(boardid=12, firstport=21, count=4, firstchannel=2)

# Digital Port Definitions
# Example - 2 digital outputs on Maestro channels 0-1 on board 12 assigned to ports 0-1
configureMaestroDigital(boardid=12, firstport=0, firstchannel=0, count=2)

# Digital Input Definitions
# Example - 4 trigger inputs indexed 0-3 on Maestro channels 9-12 on board 12
configureMaestroDigitalInputs(boardid=12, firstindex=0, firstchannel=9, count=4)

# Example - Reset Input on Maestro channel 6 of board 12
configureMaestroRunInput(boardid=12, firstchannel=6)

# Example - Main Input on Maestro channel 7 of board 12
configureMaestroMainInput(boardid=12, firstchannel=7)

# Example - Trigger Input on Maestro channel 8 of board 12
configureMaestroTriggerInput(boardid=12, firstchannel=8)
